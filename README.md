# <WeatherDashboard>

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

## Description

My motivation for this project was to be able to use a Weather API to present current weather in a city!
I built this project to understand how to connect an API; api key, id, etc.
The problem that this project solves is being able to retrieve the current status of weather for a city.
I learned how to connect and test API within Insomnia!
